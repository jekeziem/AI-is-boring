"Meaning is a human construct, so any answer is going to be correct. To me, being human means that we should be the care takers of this planet. Due to our self awareness, ability to problem solve & ability to identify and deal with the many challenges that could lead to the extinction of our species. It makes sense that our role in the animal kingdom is to provide a balanced & sustainable living environment for all flora & fauna.",Human,Reddit,Reflective / Ethical,

"Being human means you're dying, constantly. From the moment you're born you die a little each day until after 80 years or so you're a corpse. It means that you'll be trapped in a fishbowl with other humans, most of whom will be completely awful, cruel, or disappointing. The few who aren't any of these things are fated to suffer at the hands of the ones who are, and as a solitary human you're essentially just cursed to watch the horrifying and tragic story of mankind unfold.
