# AI is Boring: A Data-Driven Look at the Death of Originality in AI Writing


This project blends **data science, philosophy, and UX design** to explore one of the oldest human questions:  

“What does it mean to be human?”

The goal is to analyse how predictable, repetitive, and formulaic AI writing is — compared to real human writing using simple metrics in Python. Afterwards designing a UX concept to show how writing tools could support more originality.
