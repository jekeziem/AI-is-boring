# AI is Boring: A Data-Driven Look at the Death of Originality in AI Writing

![Dashboard Screenshot](visuals/dashboard_screenshot.png)

This project blends **data science, philosophy, and UX design** to explore one of the oldest human questions:  
> “What does it mean to be human?”

The goal is to analyze how predictable, repetitive, and formulaic AI writing is — compared to real human writing — using simple metrics in Python. We then design a UX concept to show how writing tools could support more originality.

## 🎯 Project Overview

- **Analysis:** Vocabulary richness, sentence variety, repetition, sentiment/tone.  
- **Data Sources:** Reddit posts, blog posts, tweets, and existing AI writing samples.  
- **Tech:** Python, Pandas, basic NLP libraries.  
- **UX:** Interactive Streamlit dashboard that shows human vs AI writing differences.
