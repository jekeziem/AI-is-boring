# Background Story

This project began as my piece on Substack starting as a reflection on creativity and originality in the age of artificial intelligence:

In my original essay, I explored how AI often feels like “bad weather”, disruptive yet easy to ignore, and argued that the real danger isn’t AI becoming too powerful, but us forgetting our own creative power.

I framed ideas as sacred gifts, abundant, moving like energy — and showed how science, art, and philosophy all point to the same truth: originality comes from human imagination, feeling, and soul.

This project grew out of that perspective: to show, with data and design, how human writing carries depth and unpredictability that AI still struggles to imitate.

## Project Philosophy

This project is both a **data analysis** and a **creative exploration**. We explore whether AI can truly replicate the depth and complexity of human thought — especially on abstract, emotional, and philosophical topics.

It’s about asking bigger questions:
- What makes human writing different?
- Can AI understand meaning, emotion, or soul?
- How can we design tools to enhance originality rather than replace it?
